## MotherDuck Stocks Data Workshop

This workshop will help you get data from csv into MotherDuck, and lay out basic patterns for using dbt + MotherDuck in a performant way.

### Getting Started
1. Create a MotherDuck account.
2. Create a database called "stocks" inside of MotherDuck. This can be done with the command `create database stocks;` from the MotherDuck UI.
3. Fork the `matsonj/stocks` repo in GitHub.
4. (optional) Generate an access token inside of MotherDuck and add it to your `.env` file or as a secret inside of GitHub.
